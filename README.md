## Inspiration

Telehealth is becoming a significant part of delivering medicine to patients. Ophthalmology is left behind, however, because of lack of adequate, patient-friendly testing. In an ophthalmologic exam, one of the most common and basic procedures is measuring visual acuity. If remote eye exams are to be done (and they should be for the multiple advantages of telehealth including distancing, access to remote areas, access to debilitated patients, etc.), this basic measurement has to be made available. 

## What it does

Visual acuity testing is a basic test for an ophthalmology exam and there are no easily accessible, patient-friendly, reliable validated tools to measure it remotely. I have built a Web Application known as VirtualAcuity which enables doctors to conduct visual acuity test of a patient virtually.

The application is available live at https://virtualacuity.herokuapp.com

## How we built it

The Web Application, VirtualAcuity is built using Sockets and Express in NodeJs. The frontend is built using materialize design frmaework and basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have deployed the web application on Heroku cloud platform.

## What's next for VirtualAcuity

I want to add many more features to the application in the coming future like self visual acuity testing setup and resources for people to learn more about visual acuity testing
